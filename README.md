Tempest is a desktop app designed to track weather patterns. It includes a lightweight custom graphing class, several options for data analytics, and a driver page to enter data.
Data is stored in .txt files. 

The app was developed in Java, using the Swing library for all GUI components. 

Future updates: 
  * automatic data procurement from a weather database rather than manual entry. Setup would ask for locations of interest, and data would be pulled automatically at a specified
    time each day via a scheduled OS task (runs the driver program at a certain time each day)
  * enhancements to the graphing class to allow for larger datasets (not plotting every point, but implementing more comprehensive scaling algorithms)
